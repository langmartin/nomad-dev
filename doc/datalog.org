My hack week project drops a simple datalog implementation into Nomad

** Job Datalog

** Node Datalog

** Node Database Includes Job Assertions from Allocations

** Feasibility Placements

- Job and Node assertions are compiled into the same database
- Job queries must return results
- Node queries must return results
